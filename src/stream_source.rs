//! Per-(camera, stream_kind) live media source.
//!
//! A [`StreamSource`] owns a single `BcCamera::start_video()` stream and
//! fans the decoded [`Frame`]s out via a `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel so
//! that many RTSP sessions can subscribe to the same camera without
//! opening multiple Baichuan video streams.
//!
//! Responsibilities:
//! 1. Spawn a tokio task that pulls `BcMedia` packets from
//!    [`baichuan`].
//! 2. Split Annex-B NAL streams, detect the video codec, and translate
//!    each packet into [`crate::rtsp::provider::Frame`].
//! 3. Update the shared [`LastFrameBuffer`] on I-frames / P-frames.
//! 4. Maintain the [`SdpParams`] needed to render the RTSP `DESCRIBE`
//!    body for this source (codec, SPS/PPS/VPS).
//! 5. Exit cleanly when the owning `StreamSource` is dropped (or
//!    [`StreamSource::stop`] is called) — including sending a matching
//!    `stop_video` command to the camera.
//!
//! # Audio + multi-track status
//!
//! Audio flows end-to-end: `BcMedia::Aac` passthrough via RFC 3640
//! AAC-hbr, `BcMedia::Adpcm` transcoded to G.711 µ-law (8 kHz, static
//! PT 0). `SdpParams.audio` is populated on the first observed audio
//! packet; `AudioPresence` on the owning `CameraHandle` advances
//! `Unknown → Present { codec }` at the same time. Dispatch to the
//! right RTSP transport (video vs. audio track) happens inside
//! `src/rtsp/server/session_task.rs`.
