//! helper. Several SET-style commands across the protocol surface
//! ([`set_floodlight_manual`], [`set_ledstate`], [`set_pirstate`],
//! [`set_services`], [`set_users`]) share an identical wait shape:
//! send the request, wait up to 500 ms for a reply, treat
//! response_code 200 as success, treat any non-200 as
//! [`CameraServiceUnavailable`], and treat the absence of a reply
//! within the window as success — some firmwares silently accept SET
//! commands without bothering to acknowledge.
