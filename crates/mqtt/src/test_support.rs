//! Test helpers for exercising publish plumbing without a real broker.
//!
//! `mock_client()` returns a [`SharedMqttClient`] paired with a
//! [`MockHandle`]. Every `publish` / `publish_retained` call on the
//! client is mirrored into the handle's capture buffer, so downstream
//! tests can assert on topic + payload + retained flag without spinning
//! up an MQTT broker.
//!
//! The wrapped `AsyncClient` is the same stub shape as
//! [`SharedMqttClient::for_test_stub`]: its event loop is leaked, so
//! `publish()` returns `Ok(())` after queuing on the rumqttc request
//! channel. Tests that do not await broker I/O stay synchronous.
//!
//! Only compiled under the `test-util` feature.
