//! Sample-rate conversion for voice-band audio.

/// Decimate 16 kHz PCM to 8 kHz by averaging adjacent sample pairs.
///
/// Filter: `y[n] = (x[2n] + x[2n+1] + 1) >> 1`. This is a 2-tap boxcar
/// followed by 2× decimation, rounding half-up via the +1 bias. The
/// frequency response before decimation is `H(f) = cos(π f / fs)`:
/// only ~3 dB attenuation at the new Nyquist (4 kHz) and ~12 dB at
/// 6 kHz, with a true zero at 8 kHz. Content above 4 kHz aliases into
/// 0–4 kHz with as little as 3 dB of suppression — adequate for 8 kHz
/// µ-law voice (telephony cuts off around 3.4 kHz anyway) but **not**
/// a true low-pass; it does not "avoid aliasing" in the strict
/// signal-processing sense. Replace with a windowed-sinc (e.g. 7-tap)
/// if non-voice content ever flows through this path.
///
/// `(a + b + 1) >> 1` is bias-symmetric for both signs (arithmetic
/// shift rounds toward negative infinity, the +1 lifts the rounding
/// edge to half-up). The earlier `(a + b) / 2` truncated toward zero,
/// which slightly compresses signals near zero on average.
///
/// If `pcm_16k` has an odd length, the trailing sample is dropped.
