//! The session task is a small **coordinator** that, after the PLAY

///   SETUP that appends a track is picked up on the next matching
///   frame (no `tracks_changed` subscription — `notify_one` would only
///   wake one of two waiters and we'd race).
///
/// The video loop runs `replay_burst` once before its live-dispatch
/// phase so the cached parameter-sets + I-frame still arrive before the
/// first live frame on the wire. Audio doesn't wait for replay.
///
/// **Why split:** running audio + video through a single `tokio::select!`
/// arm meant a 4 K HEVC IDR (~200–500 KB / ~150–370 RTP packets)
